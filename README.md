ProtoCollection
===============
ProtoCollection (Swedish: [ProtoKollen](README.sv.md)) is a web service that harvests and analyzes meeting minutes from the 290 Swedish municipal boards (“kommunstyrelse”). The project is funded by Vinnova.

Prerequisites
=============
 * Firefox (tested with version 32.0)
 * Xvfb (tested with version 1.15.1)
 * wvText and wvSummary from `wv` (tested with version 1.2.1),
   using either `lynx` or `elinks` (but not `links`)
 * An Amazon S3 bucket
 * [Service-account credentials](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#serviceaccounts) from the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/), if you wish to use Google Spreadsheets as the source for your harvesting. Not needed if using a local CSV file.
 * Command line access to your server
 * Internet connection (even for a dry run)

 These scripts have been tested under Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 7. Making them run under Windows would probably require some extra hacking.
 
Installation
============

 * Clone this repository
 * From the protokollen directory, run `python setup.py develop`
 * Copy `login.template.py` to `login.py`, and add your Amazon S3 and Google API credentials there
 * Copy your Google API p12 file to `google_api.p12` (or specify another path in `login.py`)

Using ProtoCollection
=====================

Harvesting documents
---------------------
The harvesting script `harvest.py` takes a table with URLs and xPath expressions. It will fetch any valid files encountered, and store them on Amazon S3.

Run `python harvest.py --help` for more info on how to feed data into the script, or `pydoc ./harvest.py` (or `pdoc ./harvest.py`) for API help.

Extracting data from documents
------------------------------
The extraction script `extractor.py` will go through files in an Amazon S3 bucket, and try to extract plain text data from them.

Run `python extractor.py --help` for more info, or `pydoc ./extractor.py` (or `pdoc ./extractor.py`) for API help.

Analyzing data
--------------
TBD

Changelog
=========

 * 0.1: First harvester

Further information might be available in [the Swedish README file](README.sv.md).
